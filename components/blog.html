    <h2>Blog</h2>
    <p class="blog-intro">This blog is where I get to share a side of myself you won’t find on a CV or LinkedIn profile. It’s a place for thoughts, stories, lessons learned, and the occasional experiment, basically anything I find worth putting into words. Some posts might be reflections, others just things I find interesting, but all of them will be honest and unfiltered, showing just me, as I am.</p>
